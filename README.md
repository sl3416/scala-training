# Functional Patterns

This repository is a template for various assignment I give during Scala training. Its purpose is to deal with all the unpleasantness of getting SBT to work and allow trainees to focus on writing code and getting it to work.

Each task should be done in its dedicated module, which contains the bare minimum for you to get started:
- an empty file in which to start adding code.
- a skeleton for tests because yes, you are expected to test your work.

Tasks should be done in the following order:
- [json](./json/README.md)
- [codecs](./codecs/README.md)
- [parsecs](./parsecs/README.md)
- [gen](./gen/README.md)

Note that each task relies on you having attended the corresponding live coding sessions. If you haven't, try to find someone who has and have them walk you through the material.
